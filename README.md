# Rosette Frontend Developer Interview Task

## Instructions
1. clone repository
2. Initialize your local server (localhost:3000):
3. Initialize local client (localhost:5000):
    ```
    cd rossete-client
    npm install
    npm start
4. go to -> http://localhost:5000

## NOTE
I change default react PORT from 3000 to 5000
by changing:
"start": "set PORT=5000 && react-scripts start"

if you use MAC, you will probably need to change it to:
"start": "PORT=5000 react-scripts start"
